      Thanks to Open Build Service packaging software for most
      distributions is easy. The review process aided by the staging
      process using openQA and Cavil makes it possible to verify that
      packages going into the repository work and are licensed under
      licenses compatible with the repository.

      openQA is an automated test tool for operating systems
      and the engine at the heart of openSUSE's automated testing
      initiative. The project is used by open-source projects like
      Fedora, Qubes OS and others.

      The Open Source Event Manager assists with communicating the value
      of an event by having a splash page, agenda and more. It allows
      for the submission of proposals for talks, rating and evaluating
      of submissions and the scheduling of events. It also provides
      analytics and lets visitors register and buy tickets for an event.
      The openSUSE Travel Support Program aims to support contributors
      representing openSUSE at events, conferences and hack-fests with
      their travel and hotel costs. The program pays up to 80% of the
      travel and/or hotel costs for contributors who could not afford
      going to these events otherwise.
